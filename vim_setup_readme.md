# Vim Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and start using Vim, a powerful text editor that's highly configurable and efficient once you learn the basics.

## Installation

Vim has been installed on your system using the Windows Package Manager (winget). The installation includes both the command-line version (vim) and the graphical version (gvim).

## Adding Vim to Your PATH

To run Vim from any terminal without specifying the full path, you need to add it to your system PATH. Two scripts have been provided to help with this:

1. **add_vim_to_path.bat** - A batch file that will run the PowerShell script with administrator privileges
2. **add_vim_to_path.ps1** - The PowerShell script that adds Vim to your system PATH

To add Vim to your PATH:

1. Right-click on `add_vim_to_path.bat` and select "Run as administrator"
2. If a UAC prompt appears, click "Yes"
3. The script will add `C:\Program Files\Vim\vim91` to your system PATH
4. You may need to restart your terminal or computer for the changes to take effect

After adding Vim to your PATH, you can run it from any terminal by typing:
- `vim` for the command-line version
- `gvim` for the graphical version

## Configuration

Vim is highly configurable through a configuration file called `.vimrc` (or `_vimrc` on Windows). A sample configuration file has been provided:

- **example_vimrc.txt** - A basic Vim configuration file with helpful settings and key mappings

To use this configuration:

1. Copy the contents of `example_vimrc.txt`
2. Create a new file named `_vimrc` in your home directory (typically `C:\Users\YourUsername\_vimrc`)
3. Paste the contents into this file
4. Save the file

The provided configuration includes:
- Syntax highlighting
- Line numbers
- Indentation settings
- Key mappings for common operations
- Mouse support
- System clipboard integration
- And many other useful settings

## Learning Vim

Vim has a steep learning curve, but it's incredibly powerful once you get used to it. To help you get started:

- **vim_cheatsheet.md** - A comprehensive cheat sheet with common Vim commands

Additionally, Vim includes a built-in tutorial that you can access by typing:
```
vimtutor
```

This will open an interactive tutorial that will teach you the basics of Vim.

## Basic Usage

Here are some essential commands to get you started:

1. **Starting Vim**:
   - `vim filename` - Open a file in Vim
   - `gvim filename` - Open a file in the graphical version of Vim

## Customizing Vim Further

As you become more comfortable with Vim, you might want to customize it further:

1. **Plugins**: Vim supports plugins that extend its functionality. Popular plugin managers include:
   - [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
   - [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
   - [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

2. **Colorschemes**: Change the appearance of Vim with different color schemes:
   - Type `:colorscheme [name]` to try a different color scheme
   - Add `colorscheme [name]` to your `.vimrc` to make it permanent

3. **Filetype-specific settings**: Add settings that only apply to certain file types:
   ```vim
   autocmd FileType javascript setlocal tabstop=2 shiftwidth=2
   ```

Remember that the best way to learn Vim is through practice. Start with the basics and gradually incorporate more advanced features as you become comfortable.
