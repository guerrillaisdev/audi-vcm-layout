# Cline Rules: VCM Scanner Layout Configuration Project

## Project Patterns

### File Structure
- XML-based configuration files are the primary artifact
- Memory Bank documentation in Markdown format
- Follow hierarchical organization for both code and documentation

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names for all parameters and displays
- Maintain consistent naming patterns across related elements
- Prefix math channels with "Calc_" to distinguish from direct parameters

### Implementation Approach
- Start with core functionality, then expand to advanced features
- Test incrementally after each significant change
- Document decisions and rationale in Memory Bank

## User Preferences

### Communication Style
- Technical and precise language preferred
- Visual representations help convey layout concepts
- Step-by-step explanations for technical implementations

### Work Priorities
- Functionality takes precedence over aesthetics
- Critical engine monitoring parameters are highest priority
- Focus on parameters relevant to the specific vehicle modifications

## Technical Insights

### Vehicle-Specific Knowledge
- Modified with K04 turbo requiring higher boost pressure ranges
- Upgraded intercooler may affect temperature readings
- Custom exhaust affects back pressure and related parameters
- AEM gauges provide additional data sources

### VCM Scanner Insights
- XML structure must maintain specific format for compatibility
- Some parameters may have different names than expected
- Math channels have performance impact if too complex
- Trigger conditions should be carefully tuned to avoid excessive logging

## Implementation Paths

### Parameter Configuration
1. Identify parameter in VCM Scanner
2. Determine appropriate display type
3. Configure min/max ranges based on modified components
4. Set warning thresholds
5. Add to appropriate display groups

### Math Channel Setup
1. Define input parameters
2. Create formula with correct operators
3. Set output range and units
4. Add to displays where needed
5. Verify calculation accuracy

### Trigger Configuration
1. Select parameter to monitor
2. Define threshold condition
3. Set logging parameters
4. Configure reset conditions
5. Test under actual conditions

## Known Challenges

### Technical Limitations
- Not all desired parameters may be available
- Some parameters may have slow update rates
- Complex layouts may impact scanner performance
- Some modified components may affect sensor readings

### Implementation Considerations
- Balance between comprehensive monitoring and usability
- Appropriate warning thresholds for modified components
- Organizing related parameters effectively
- Creating intuitive navigation between different views

## Evolution Notes
- Project begins with documentation and planning
- Implementation will follow systematic approach from core to advanced features
- Testing with actual vehicle connection is essential
- Expect iterative refinement based on real-world performance
