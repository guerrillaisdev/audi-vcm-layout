# Product Context: VCM Scanner Layout Configuration

## Why This Project Exists
This project exists to create a customized monitoring solution for a heavily modified Audi vehicle. The standard VCM Scanner layouts don't adequately address the specific needs of a performance-modified vehicle with numerous aftermarket components. A custom layout will provide better visibility into critical engine parameters and help monitor the health and performance of the modified components.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Inadequate Monitoring**: Stock layouts don't focus on the right parameters for modified vehicles
2. **Performance Optimization**: Need to track key metrics during tuning and performance driving
3. **Early Warning System**: Detect potential issues before they cause damage
4. **Diagnostic Efficiency**: Quickly identify problems when they occur
5. **Data Correlation**: See relationships between different parameters (e.g., boost vs. AFR)

## How It Should Work
The VCM Scanner layout should:
1. Load seamlessly into VCM Scanner 5.0.4
2. Display critical parameters in easy-to-read gauges and graphs
3. Organize information logically based on related systems (engine, fueling, temperatures)
4. Provide visual warnings when parameters exceed safe thresholds
5. Automatically trigger logging during important events (WOT, knock, high boost)
6. Calculate derived values through math channels for additional insights
7. Allow quick switching between different view layouts

## User Experience Goals
1. **Clarity**: Information should be immediately understandable at a glance
2. **Prioritization**: Most critical parameters should be most prominent
3. **Logical Grouping**: Related parameters should be displayed together
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Use size, color, and position to indicate importance
5. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent design patterns throughout the layout
6. **Responsiveness**: Graphs and gauges should update smoothly in real-time
7. **Adaptability**: Layout should work well during different driving scenarios (idle, cruise, WOT)

## Target User
The layout is designed for an enthusiast with:
1. Technical knowledge of engine management and performance tuning
2. Understanding of the specific modifications made to the vehicle
3. Need to monitor vehicle performance during normal driving and performance testing
4. Desire to diagnose and troubleshoot potential issues
