# Progress: VCM Scanner Layout Configuration

## Current Status
**Project Phase**: Implementation
**Completion**: ~60%
**Last Updated**: March 17, 2025

## What Works
- Project requirements have been clearly defined
- Vehicle modification list has been documented
- Memory Bank structure has been established
- Core documentation files have been created
- Base template has been analyzed
- Layout XML file has been created with all required components

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning (Completed)
- [x] Analyze hptlayout.Layout.xml template
- [x] Identify all relevant parameters for modified vehicle
- [x] Create detailed layout design plan
- [x] Define math channel formulas
- [x] Establish trigger conditions

### Phase 2: Initial Implementation (Completed)
- [x] Configure primary gauge cluster
  - [x] Engine metrics gauges
  - [x] Boost pressure gauge
  - [x] Temperature gauges
  - [x] Warning thresholds
- [x] Set up math channels
  - [x] AFR calculation
  - [x] Boost PSI conversion
  - [x] Injector duty cycle
- [x] Create initial graph layouts
  - [x] Engine performance graph
  - [x] Fueling & timing graph

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Completed)
- [x] Configure triggers
  - [x] WOT detection
  - [x] Knock event detection
  - [x] High boost monitoring
- [x] Implement secondary data displays
  - [x] Digital readouts
  - [x] Bar graphs
  - [x] Supporting metrics

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (In Progress)
- [ ] Validate layout in VCM Scanner
- [ ] Test with vehicle connection
- [ ] Verify parameter readings
- [ ] Test under various driving conditions
- [ ] Refine based on real-world performance

### Phase 5: Finalization
- [ ] Document final configuration
- [ ] Create user guide
- [ ] Backup final layout
- [ ] Deliver completed layout

## Known Issues
1. **Parameter Availability**: Need to confirm all parameters are accessible when connected to the vehicle
2. **Parameter IDs**: Some parameter IDs in the layout are assumptions and may need adjustment
3. **Integration Questions**: How to best incorporate data from AEM gauges still needs to be resolved
4. **Performance Impact**: Need to assess impact of comprehensive layout on scanner performance

## Recent Progress
- Created project brief with detailed requirements
- Documented complete list of vehicle modifications
- Established Memory Bank documentation structure
- Created core documentation files
- Analyzed the hptlayout.Layout.xml template
- Created the audi-k04-layout.Layout.xml file with all required components:
  - Primary gauge cluster
  - Digital dashboard
  - Performance graphs
  - Math channels
  - Trigger configurations

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Load the layout into VCM Scanner 5.0.4
2. Connect to vehicle to verify parameter readings
3. Adjust parameter IDs if needed
4. Fine-tune gauge ranges based on actual readings

## Success Metrics Tracking
| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| All parameters correctly mapped | In Progress | Parameters mapped in layout, need to verify with vehicle |
| Gauges show appropriate ranges | Implemented | Ranges set based on modified components, may need fine-tuning |
| Graphs update smoothly | Implemented | Graph configurations complete, need to test performance |
| Math channels calculate accurately | Implemented | Formulas implemented, need to verify calculations |
| Triggers function as specified | Implemented | Trigger conditions set, need to test activation |
| Layout loads in VCM Scanner 5.0.4 | Not Tested | Layout file created, needs to be loaded and tested |

## Blockers
- Need to connect to vehicle to verify parameter availability and IDs
- Need to test layout in VCM Scanner 5.0.4
- Need to validate parameter readings with actual vehicle data
