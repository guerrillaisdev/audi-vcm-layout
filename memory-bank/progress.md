  - [ ] Confirm gauge layouts and scaling
- [ ] Test with vehicle connection
  - [ ] Verify parameter IDs are correct
  - [ ] Check for missing or unavailable parameters
- [ ] Verify parameter readings
  - [ ] Validate math channel calculations
  - [ ] Test trigger activations
- [ ] Test under various driving conditions
  - [ ] Idle monitoring
  - [ ] Normal driving
  - [ ] Performance/WOT testing
- [ ] Refine based on real-world performance

### Phase 5: Finalization
- [ ] Document final configuration
- [ ] Create user guide
- [ ] Backup final layout
- [ ] Deliver completed layout

## Known Issues
1. **Parameter Availability**: Need to confirm all parameters are accessible when connected to the vehicle
2. **Parameter IDs**: Several parameter IDs in the layout are marked as assumptions and need verification
3. **AEM Gauge Integration**: Need to determine how to incorporate data from the AEM gauges (Boost, Oil Pressure, Wideband AFR)
4. **Performance Impact**: Need to assess impact of comprehensive layout on scanner performance
5. **Deployment Method**: Symbolic link creation requires administrator privileges
6. **Math Channel Accuracy**: Need to verify calculations with actual readings

## Recent Progress
- Created project brief with detailed requirements
- Documented complete list of vehicle modifications
- Established Memory Bank documentation structure
- Created core documentation files
- Analyzed the hptlayout.Layout.xml template
- Created the audi-k04-layout.Layout.xml file with all required components:
  - Primary gauge cluster
  - Digital dashboard
  - Performance graphs
  - Math channels
  - Trigger configurations
- Deployed the layout file to VCM Scanner Layouts directory
- Created deployment scripts for efficient workflow:
  - create_symlink.bat for symbolic link approach
  - update_layout.ps1 for file copy approach
- Added comprehensive K04 Performance Charts organized into separate tabs:
  - K04 Air/Boost Charts tab:
    - Air Flow and Pressure chart (MAF, MAP, Calculated Boost PSI)
    - Knock and Timing chart with RPM correlation
  - K04 Boost Control tab:
    - Boost Control chart with N75 duty cycle monitoring
    - Temperature monitoring chart (IAT, ECT, Oil Temperature)
  - Added K04 Fueling Charts as a sub-tab under Fueling & Timing:
    - Fueling chart with AFR and injector pulse width
    - Fuel Trims chart with injector duty cycle monitoring
- Reorganized layout to improve readability and prevent overlapping components
- Optimized tab hierarchy by placing related charts under appropriate parent tabs
- Updated Memory Bank documentation with current status and next steps

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Open VCM Scanner 5.0.4 and load the layout file
2. Verify all tabs, gauges, and displays appear correctly
3. Check for any XML parsing errors
4. Verify the new K04 Performance Charts section displays correctly
5. Test reference lines in charts to ensure they provide useful visual thresholds
6. Connect to vehicle to verify parameter readings
7. Document any parameters that need ID adjustments
8. Begin testing math channel calculations
